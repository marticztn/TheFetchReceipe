### Summary: Include screen shots or a video of your app highlighting its features
    Sure! Media files are uploaded to the Github! (TheFetchRecipe -> Media folder)

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
    I chose to focus on getting the main feature done first, then the UI. Specifically, the network fetch with aync/await, and the image caching mechanism. I believe these are the most important features for this project, since caching minimizes network usage, improves UX (less loading time), thus it should be prioritized.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
    I spent on this project for roughly 3.5 hours, that 0.5 hour is used for polishing the code, and trying to find potential bugs throughout the app. For the 3 hours, I spent about 2 hours to get the basic functionalities done, that includes: basic UI, fetch recipes, list recipes, and scrollable views, for the remaining 1 hour, I was polishing the UI, and running the app on multiple simulated devices / iOS versions to ensure the UI/UX are consistent (and made a little icon for the app)

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
    I don't think I made any significant trade-offs, but if I have to say one (and it is a minor one), it's probably the picture-enlargement feature. I initially wanted to do a hero effect which feels more seameless when you click on the image, I could use matchedGeometryEffect for that but then I realized it will probably make the code structure just a bit more complex. I mainly prioritize getting the core functionality of this project done first, so I think this can be done in a later time :)

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
    I think the weakest part is the caching mechanism. Nowadays we are probably all relying on built-in packages or third-party packages for image caching / data retrieving, so I havent't done this for a long time. Doing this all by myself for the first time in a while is definitely more challenging compare to getting other requirements done, but it is very interesting! Even though existing packages will probably achieve higher efficiency compare to that what I implemented, learning and knowing those under the hood magics always motivate me a lot, so I actually very appreciate you guys that this is included in the requirement section :D 

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
    That's all, thank you very much for giving me this interesting project, I actually learned a lot and I really appreciate it! :)
